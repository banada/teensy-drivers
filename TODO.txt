Build against the kernel - 
    Do we have the USB headers? - libusb

Load a module into the kernel
    Auto-detected by USB subsystem on hotplug
    Compatability? (Recognized by kernel)

    register with usb_register()

* 0. build & load module, print to kernel log
1. w/o LED - print to log when device is recognized
    print device ID
2. automatically trigger LED to blink
    send USB commands
    receive USB commands
    Run an Arduino sketch listening for USB?
        receive command > trigger blink directly
        build rawhid example along with sketch
        sketch controls the LED
3. Manually trigger LED to blink
    kernel on the host controls the LED
